VIT has a massive campus spanning 372 acres which accommodates its exceptional educational infrastructure and living facilities, so it is important that traversing the campus is easy and efficient and the shuttle system meets the institutionâ€™s exemplary standards. This project aims to modernise the shuttle system and make it more efficient.The main goal is to make the shuttle system more efficient so that it is more convenient to use and reliable for the students and easier to manage by the administration. It allows students to see the live location of the shuttles running in the campus so that they can choose the shuttle nearest to them and make an informed decision about what traversal option they should go with. It also allows them to book the shuttle and pay in advance which saves time and makes the system more efficient. On the administrative side they have a well-defined way of tracking all bookings and keeping record of earnings which also eliminates the need for extra paper usage.
